# MERN_tutorial

I am following along [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBTYxXADG_k&list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE&index=2&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) tutorial to learn how the technologies of the MERN stack as well as how to deploy a full stack program.


### Part 1: Express API and MongoDB
Created a back end to GET, POST, and DELETE items. Stored using MongoDB.

### Part2: Setting up the client and using react and react strap
Created the client using react and reactstrap

### Part3: Displaying data client side
Showing hardcoded data on the client as well as deleting it (not from the database but just updating the component state).

### Part4: Implementing Redux
Rather than having each component have it's own state, we used Redux to have a global state to keep track of everything. 

### Part5: Connecting Front End to Back End
Instead of using static data for the front end and making requests via PostMan for the backend, we should make requests starting from the front end, to our backend routes, and update the database.

### Part6: Deployment
Now that we have a full stack app, we can deploy it. I used heroku to deploy and after working out a few kinks, it is live! You can find it [here](https://aqueous-falls-30734.herokuapp.com/)
